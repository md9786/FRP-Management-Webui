# Go-Based FRP Management UI

A comprehensive, self-hosted web UI for managing [FRP (A fast reverse proxy)](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) clients and servers on a Linux system. Built with Go and a modern frontend stack, this dashboard provides real-time monitoring, configuration management, live log streaming, and more, all from a single, easy-to-use interface.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Linux server with `systemd`.
- Go (version 1.18+ recommended).
- Root or `sudo` privileges (required for service management and file storage in `/root`).

### Installation
1.  Build the binary from the `main.go` source file:
    ```bash
    go build -o frp-panel .
    ```
2.  Create a directory for the application's templates.
    ```bash
    mkdir templates
    ```
3.  Place all `.html` files into the `templates` directory.
4.  Run the binary. The server will start on port `5001`.
    ```bash
    ./frp-panel
    ```
5.  Access the UI in your browser at `http://<your-server-ip>:5001`.
6.  Log in with the default credentials:
    - **Username:** `admin`
    - **Password:** `admin`

### First-Time Setup
After logging in for the first time:
1.  Navigate to **Setup & Presets** from the sidebar.
2.  Select the **System Management** tab.
3.  Click the **Install/Update FRP** button. This will download the latest `frps` and `frpc` binaries from GitHub and set up the necessary `systemd` service files on your system.

## üìÅ Configuration & Data Storage

The application stores all its data and FRP configurations in the `/root/frp/` directory by default. Ensure this path is accessible and writable by the user running the application.

- `/root/frp/client/`: Stores `frpc` client configurations (`.toml` files).
- `/root/frp/server/`: Stores `frps` server configurations (`.toml` files).
- `/root/frp/users.json`: Stores user credentials (passwords are hashed).
- `/root/frp/presets.json`: Stores client configuration presets.
- `/root/frp/server_presets.json`: Stores server configuration presets.

## üì° API Overview

The backend provides a RESTful API for the frontend to consume.

- `GET /api/system/info`: Provides real-time system metrics (CPU, RAM, Network).
- `GET /api/system/history`: Returns historical network data for the dashboard chart.
- `GET /api/connections/status`: Fetches the current status of all configured FRP services.
- `GET /api/presets`, `POST /api/presets/save`, etc.: Full CRUD operations for managing client and server presets.
- `GET /ws/logs/:type/:name`: The WebSocket endpoint for live log streaming.
